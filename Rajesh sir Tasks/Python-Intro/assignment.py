# # # # # Compilation: The Python code is compiled into bytecode (.pyc file).
# # # # # Execution: PVM executes the bytecode using its runtime environment.
# # # # # PVM is responsible for interpreting the bytecode and ensuring the program runs as expected.
# # # # # #

# # # # # 7. Compiler vs Interpreter
# # # # #
# # # # Feature:              	Compiler	                                                                     Interpreter
# # # # Execution:	Translates entire source code at once into machine code (executable file).	Translates and executes source code line by line.
# # # # Speed:	Faster during execution since translation is done in advance.	Slower as translation and execution occur simultaneously.
# # # # Error Detection:	Detects errors after scanning the entire code.	Stops execution and reports errors when encountered.
# # # # Output:	Produces an executable file (.exe or machine code).	No separate file; executes the code directly.
# # # # Languages	Used by: languages like C, C++, and Java.	Used by languages like Python, JavaScript, Ruby.

# # # 8. Flavours of Python
# # # # # # Python has several flavours or implementations, each with its own strengths and use cases:
